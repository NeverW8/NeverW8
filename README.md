# Projects?  

Some projects that are pretty bad (tbh) but have a pretty cool idea behind it that I wanna share is TCG (Twitch Clip Generator) and most likely the Twitch Viewbot (which doesn't work by reason :P )
These projects are just an idea of some stuff I like working with.

# Learning & Background

I'm currently digging deep into DevOps design and eventually learning python, this is because I lack general programming experience.
I come from a SysAdmin/SysOps/DevOps kind of background with knowledge about server management, scripting, automation (CI/CD) etc., 
my knowledge sits best inside Linux & Open source enviroments and I'm trying to become better at general coding outside the expertise I already learned.

# Where can I find a resume / contact details?

If you do some googling you'll find my resume on my website, but I would suggest you add me on Discord@ FiskenHero#0001

# Other stuff

I like beer, guitars, my dog, my computers and videogames.

I'm very bad at updating my projects here. Cheers!
