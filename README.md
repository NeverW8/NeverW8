- 👋 Hi, I’m @NeverW8 , aka Carl.
- 👀 I’m interested in weird projects, guitars/music and training with my dog!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DevOps stuff and trying to become better with Programming.
- 💞️ I'm quite busy right now, but I always end up making something strange ![KEKW](https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/381875/1)
- 📫 How to reach me: Fiskenhero on discord.

# Learning & Background

Old Linux Sysadmin fella that ended up as a DevOps.

# Where can I find a resume / contact details?

If you do some googling you'll find my resume on my website, but I would suggest you add me on Discord@ FiskenHero since it's most likely not up to date.. at all!
